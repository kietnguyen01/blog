A few years back, I read that cryptocurrency was supposed to be the next financial revolution. Proponents of the tech said that crypto offered the following advantages:

- Lower transaction fees than banks.
- Fast payment settlement.
- Cheap international transfers.
- Decentralized network with no central authority.

I thought to myself those reasons sounded pretty good. I spent some time learning about how crypto works, set up account at an exchange, and tried to use crypto for sending money to my friends and family overseas. 

## Crypto Has Problems

They didn’t like it. Turned out they had to deal with several problems:

- No easy way to cash out at banks or financial services.
- Needed to make an account at a crypto exchange to exchange crypto to cash.
- Difficult to use interface and lack of technical support.
- Large price fluctuations on a daily basis.

They asked me why I didn’t send them money through a regular remittance service? I told them that I thought sending money through crypto would be cheaper. They told me that the problems they had to face caused them more pain than simply paying the 2% remittance fees.

I had to agree with them.

Since I have technical knowledge, using crypto for me didn’t pose a significant problem. But for people who struggles with tech, crypto is extremely difficult to use. The only thing that crypto has going for it is the low fees compared to remittance services.

Or is it?

## Comparing Remittance Fees

I’m going to answer that question by using actual data.

The data that I’ll be gathering are:

- The fees, transactions, volume, etc. of cryptocurrencies that are used as mediums of exchange.
- Same data as above for cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the dollar (stablecoins).
- Public data on remittance service fees to/from each country.

For the time range, I will use the last crypto bull run, which started in 2019 and ended in 2022. Then I will run an EDA on each type of remittance to uncover some insights about them. The types of analysis I will perform are likely to be descriptive and predictive analytics. The last step is visualizing the results.
