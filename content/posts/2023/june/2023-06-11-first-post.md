I'm going to use this blog as a way for me to document the projects I'll be working on. While it's sufficient to simply use Git and the completed project as documentation, it's often not enough for the detailed analysis of the process. There are times when I encounter novel problems, and it often takes me a while to work through them. My thought process during that time is what I want to write down.

Things I want to jot down are:

- What was the problem?
- What went wrong?
- Why did it go wrong?
- How did I go about solving it?
- Did I have to use a workaround?
- What did I need to learn?

These are the things that I want to note down for each project. Hopefully, this blog can serve as a good mental reference for me in the future.
